## Hi, I’m SARAH!
#### I’m a big fun of CODING! 
#### I use PYTHON a lot. I also code in SQL, GAMs and MATLAB. 

#### Fun fact: 
#### I am tring to build a bakery website for my baking receipes. 
#### Baking is similar to coding: They both need time to learn, try and practice.
## Love coding, love baking!
