## Hi, I’m SARAH!
#### I’m a big fun of CODING! 
#### I use PYTHON a lot. I also code in SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, GAMs and MATLAB. 
#### I am learning buidling full stack web apps with python flask framework and HTML/CSS/Javascript.
#### I have learned and built a <a href="https://sarahcampweb.onrender.com">yelpcamp</a> web applications with node.js last year.

#### Fun fact: 
#### I am tring to build a bakery website for my baking receipes. 
#### Baking is similar to coding: They both need time to learn, try and practice.
## Love coding, love baking!
